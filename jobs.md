{% comment %}

We don't have specific open positions available at the moment. However, we do welcome inquiries regarding PhD or postdoc research if these address major questions in visual data analysis (e.g. visual design, computational or perceptual scalability, interaction with the expert user). In case of a good fit we can apply for specific funding for this.

## :: Scientific programmer in data visualisation ::

Although different generic data visualisation tools exist (such as Tableau and Spotfile), there is a specific need for custom visualisation (eg hive plots, horizon charts, and plots that incorporate domain-specific information) when working with complex datasets. In this project we will build a **framework for creating custom visualisations and combining these in a dashboard-setting**. The aim is to create the necessary **front- and backend** to allow for (1) easily creating and incorporating new visual modules (conceptually similar to https://github.com/jandot/bio-graphics), (2) combining these visual modules in a single interface, and (3) incorporating a biological ontology which links biological concepts to features in the visuals.

The code developed in this project will be partly open sourced, and we aim for reaching a large community in the biological sciences initially, but later also in other domains.

### Job description

The candidate will work in close collaboration with a genomics researcher, and be responsible for:

* Analysis and deconstruction of prior work
* Co-develop data schema, develop data storage solution, and data loading scripts for omics-specific data
* Develop proof-of-concept interface which links different visualisations
* Implementation of custom visuals designed by visualisation experts

### Profile

We offer a challenging position within a dynamic and stimulating environment and ask for a highly motivated, enthusiastic and pro-active person. The applicant needs to have demonstrable experience in web-development and software management. This includes strong programming skills in javascript and if possible python, and/or clojurescript.

### Appointment

The successful candidate will be appointed for a period of 2 years at KU Leuven, starting at or as soon as possible after April 1st 2019. Salary will depend on diploma ("barema") and experience ("trede"). [Barema 44](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/wedde/graadbarema/ap/barema44.pdf) applies to applicants who completed a doctorate; [barema 43](https://admin.kuleuven.be/personeel/wedde/graadbarema/ap/barema43.pdf) applies to applicants without.

### How to apply

For more information regarding this function, please contact jan.aerts@uhasselt.be or vera.vannoort@kuleuven.be.

Please send - in PDF format:

* curriculum vitae
* motivation letter
* a brief description how you would approach this problem, and which technologies you would use
* link(s) to work that you already did regarding web-development

## :: PhD position in data visualization and analytics in archaeology ::

The Visual Data Analysis Lab and Research[x]Design Lab at the KU Leuven (Belgium) have a joint open PhD position in the field of data science and visualization / interaction design. The candidate will be part of a multidisciplinary team of researchers around the **Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project, covering the domains of archaeology, geography, ecology and spatial planning**.

### The project

We seek to unravel the interdisciplinary understanding of change and its space/time dimensions within already existing and future data sources of the Sagalassos project (running since 1986), which investigates an archaeological site in Turkey and studies its uninterrupted occupation over nearly 2,000 years in all its aspects, from daily life, diet, religious beliefs, to architecture, production, trade and its mechanisms, as well as natural resources and environmental conditions of the past.

This is a joint project between research groups of archaeology, ecology, geography, architecture and data analysis/visualization (STADIUS and RxD). The candidate will be supervised by Profs Aerts and Vande Moere at STADIUS and RxD, respectively, in close collaborations with the other partners in the project.

## :: Visualizing text from patient records ::

### Scientific context

Patient records and clinical reports include a vast amount of crucial information that is stored as free text, but that is unstructured and requires a human to make sense of it (e.g. “vague pain in belly which radiates to back”). Research into semantic processing of these texts (“machine reading“) is a hot topic at the moment and aims to not merely extract the individual components of these texts, but actually come to a deeper machine “understanding”, including temporal, spatial and causal structures and relationships.

The ACCUMULATE consortium recently received 4-year funding for “Acquiring Crucial Medical Information Using Language Technology”. Our role in this project is to develop data visualization methods to (a) support the development of the machine reading algorithms, and (b) present the extracted information to the doctor. For the first, we will for example create abstract interactive visualizations showing the effects of using different parameters in the algorithms; the latter will include (but not be limited to) creating visuals that combine the information from the unstructured text with additional information such as episodes, medication, etc.
To do this, we have 2 fully-funded positions available at the moment, for a 4-year PhD student and a 1-year postdoctoral researcher. Both positions will include working with the users, visual design, implementation of data visualizations, and evaluation.

### Requirements

#### PhD student

* A strong MSc degree in computer science or design, or a field related to human-computer interaction
* Some experience in visual design or data visualization (e.g. using D3), preferably of text
* Good programming skills (preferably javascript)

#### Postdoctoral researcher

* PhD which combines computer science with visual design
* Demonstrably track record in visualization of textual information

### How to apply

To apply, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work.
We will start reviewing applications in October 2015, but applications will be considered until the positions are filled.

## :: MECOVI - Medical Collaborative Visualization ::
**Did you ever want to use your design background to save lives?** We're hiring!

Cancer- and epilepsy-patients as well as early-born babies are a few examples of people who are in the care of entire teams of specialists, ranging from radiologists and oncologists to cardiologists, neurologists and other -ologists. Communication between these experts is of course crucial, but the tools that they use for this often date from the stone age (powerpoint with screenshots, for example.)

We want to change that.

In collaboration with companies such as Barco, which develops big screen hardware, we want to focus on the design/visualization-end of these interactions. Some questions that we would like to answer include: To what extent can data from one field be abstracted so that an expert in another field can still understand it? What would a good interactive expert-oriented visual overview look like that can be used as a scaffold to attach more detailed information? Can we find a way to gracefully degrade that overview in settings where one of the collaborators works remotely on a small or low-resolution screen? Can we integrate for example neurology data with cardiology?

But we need your help...

If you have a design background and know your way around user-driven design and programming data visualizations using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you may be the person we are looking for. If you're interested to play a role, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "MECOVI" in your application. We'd like to find someone by February...

In case you have an MSc, the position is initially for 15 months, but if we're a good match additional funding will be sought to prolong this for a full PhD study. Postdoctoral researchers are free to apply as well, but in that case funding will be for a shorter period.

## :: MyHealthData - Empowering the patient ::
In the old days, all information relevant to a patient would have been hand-written on pieces of paper stored in the doctor's office. Things have changed. Not only is there the electronic patient record containing an individual's full history, but a lot of other relevant information is available such as medical guidelines, aggregated characteristics of comparable patients, and projections into the future. **Wouldn't it be nice if we could let patients/citizens give full access to and insight in their own data?** We believe so...

In collaboration with different Belgian content providers (electronic health record providers, caregivers, health insurers, ...) we want to build tools to unlock this information to the patient. This will involve data analytics, visualization, and user experience research. To help us in this effort, we are looking to hire a **data scientist** versed in the field of data visualization but also not shy to perform data analysis. Specific topics that will be covered include (but will not be limited to) data exploration, improving interpretability of black-box machine learning algorithms, and development of privacy-aware visual encodings.

So if you're a data scientist who not only knows how to cluster datasets but also how to design visualizations (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested to play a role in this project, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "MyHealthData" in your application. We'd like to find someone by February...

If you have an MSc, the position is originally available for 2 years, but in case of a good match additional funding will be sought for PhD study. If you're a postdoctoral researcher, you're welcome to apply as well, although the funded period will initially be shorter.

## :: Virogenesis - Advanced phylogeny visualization ::
Viruses are the cause of many common human diseases, from the not-so-serious as common cold and cold sores, to the very-serious like HIV and Ebola. Unfortunately, the **tools to identify and follow the spread of these viruses leave a lot to be improved**. In the European Virogenesis project, we want to change this by building the bioinformatics tools to diagnose viral diseases, monitor their evolution within patients, and track viral outbreaks (think "Ebola").

Therefore, we are looking to hire a **PhD student** to focus on the **visualization** aspects of this project. This includes (but will not be limited to) addressing scalability, uncertainty, and interactivity of phylogenetic trees. In addition, we need to devise ways to combine these trees with for example geo-location data, and find visual encodings to represent changes in viromes.

Initial funding is available for 3 years. Additional funding will be sought to extend this to 4 full years. Postdoctoral researchers are welcome to apply as well, but initial funding will be for a shorter period.

Are you interested in helping us out and have a background in omics data analysis and/or data visualization (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org)? If so, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "Virogenesis" in your application.

## :: GeoPatterns - Visual analytics in geolocation data ::
Imagine being an air traffic controller and wanting to know if a plane is not following the route it should be following. Or imagine being a maritime law enforcement officer and wanting to identify which ships in the Indian ocean might be pirate ships. This is surprisingly difficult to do, because you can't always know beforehand what to look for. This is where **geo-spatial data visualization** comes in, showing the trajectories of these planes or ships on a map in combination with additional data.

But is it that simple? No. How can you find that one ship that you're interested in amongst the thousands of ships on your screen? In this project, we would like to develop visual analytics techniques for easy **identification of "abnormal" behaviour in geo-spatial data**, in collaboration with [Luciad](http://www.luciad.com), a Leuven-based company specialized in situational awareness that helps their users to gain insight in large time-dependent geo-spatial data.

*Ship movements at port of Rotterdam. van de Laar et al, Situation Awareness with Systems of Systems*

Therefore, Luciad and our lab are looking to **hire a PhD researcher** under the conditions of a [IWT Baekeland grant](http://www.iwt.be/english/funding/subsidy/BM), which is a personal scholarship assigned to you. The research would be in very close collaboration with Luciad.

So if you're a data scientist who has some background in machine learning (clustering, ...) and is interested in learning to create interactive data visualizations (e.g. using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org), you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested to play a role in this project, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be (cc to bart.adams@luciad.com), and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "GeoPattern" in your application. Deadline for the grant proposal submission is beginning of March, which means we need someone in the first half of February. The grant procedure includes an **oral defense in Brussels by the candidate**, so it helps if you're from Belgium or not that far away.

## :: ScienceWithoutBorders - Visualizing genomic structural variation ::
For years, we thought that single small changes in the DNA (single nucleotide polymorphisms) were the main actors in what distinguished the diseased from the healthy, the susceptible from the resistant. But now it becomes more and more clear that larger **structural genomic variations** (insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations) play an important role as well. Why were these hidden for so long? Because the data is more difficult to find and analyze. Nevertheless, their analysis comes more and more under pressure because people start looking at the single-cell level, for example to see how tumours evolve over time.

To help the analysis and interpretation of this type of data, we need to work on methods for **visually representing these variations**. And for that, we are looking to hire a **PhD student** under the Brazilian [Science Without Borders](http://www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng/) (Ciência sem fronteiras) umbrella.

Funding for this project is provided by the Brazilian government, which means that only people with the **Brazilian nationality** can apply.

Do you have the Brazilian nationality? And do you have a background in data visualization (*e.g.* using [Processing](http://processing.org) or [D3](http://d3js.org)), or know your way in genome analysis? Then you might be the person we're looking for. If you're interested, please send an email to jan.aerts@kuleuven.be, and include (preferably in PDF): [a] your CV, [b] two references (with email and phone number), [c] if available, one or more figures and/or screencasts of previous data visualization work. Please mention "ScienceWithoutBorders" in your application.
