  bio: |
    Jan has a background in genetics and genomics, and performed his doctoral research at the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) on the Chicken Genome Sequencing Project. He then moved to Scotland to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Roslin Institute on the Cow Genome Sequencing Project. Next, he continued his research at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge (UK) focusing on structural variation in the human and other primate genomes. At his return to Belgium at the KU Leuven in 2010 (as assistent and later associate professor), he shifted focus to data visualization and visual analytics, with the aim of finding interesting questions in large datasets (big data). His main research topics revolve around visual design, interaction design, and (human and computational) scalability. Since 2019, he is professor at Hasselt University where he continues his visual analytics work and helps build a new Data Science Institute.

    Jan has been on the organising committees of several conferences (including BioVis and Beyond The Genome), and has chaired visualization-related sessions at conferences including VIZBI, the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference BOSC and EuroVis/VMLS. He is also Associate Editor for the BioMedCentral Thematic Series on Biological Data Visualization, and academic editor for PLoS One. He was founding member of the Young Academy – Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Sciences and the Arts.
