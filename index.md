The **Visual Data Analysis Lab** (with students at UHasselt and KU Leuven) supports domain experts and lay users to make sense of large and/or complex datasets. Using a visual analytics approach, automated analysis techniques are combined with interactive data visualization to enable reasoning and hypothesis generation.

The methodology is particularly well-fit for the **discovery of unexpected phenomena in large and dynamic datasets**; it is the best approach for tackling open problems for which no clear solutions seem to exist, and even the questions are unknown. Our focus is on **visual design**, **interactive data visualisation**, and **topological data analysis**.
