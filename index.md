The Visual Data Analysis Lab is part of the Biosystems department of the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium. Our mission is to delve into the **complexity of biological systems, integrating diverse datasets** to uncover the inherent variability of nature. This includes aspects like multi-omics, climate, ecology, etc.

Using a **visual analytics** and **topological data analysis** approach, we blend automated analysis techniques with interactive data visualization, fostering a deep understanding of large and dynamic datasets. Our methodology shines in revealing hidden patterns and unexpected phenomena, especially in open-ended research where questions are as yet undefined.

Our emphasis lies in comprehending the context surrounding the complex systems in agriculture and climate, delving into the intricate interplay of factors that define these environments. By combining visual design, interactive data visualisation and machine learning, we aim to contribute vital insights into pressing issues like biodiversity, sustainability and resilience in ecological systems.
