### Augmented Intelligence: data-driven, human-aware

The **Visual Data Analysis Lab** is part of the Biosystems department of the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven, Belgium. The lab supports domain experts and lay users to make sense of large and/or complex datasets. Using a visual analytics approach, automated analysis techniques are combined with interactive data visualization to enable reasoning and hypothesis generation.

The methodology is particularly well-fit for the **discovery of unexpected phenomena in large and dynamic datasets**; it is the best approach for tackling open problems for which no clear solutions seem to exist, and even the questions are unknown.

By applying **visual design**, **interactive data visualisation** and **machine learning** to agricultural and other data, the lab hopes to contribute to tackling current challenges in **agriculture and climate**, such as biodiversity, sustainability and robustness.
